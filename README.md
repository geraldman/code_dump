### 1. DNA-string-genome-processor.py
for short, it will take a text file that contains DNA Genome sequence
and process it based on the chosen action:

- [1] Compute a reverse complement of a k-mer pattern

- [2] Count a k-mer pattern

- [3] Find most frequent k-mer patterns

### 2. mutliply-and-exponential-with-addition.cpp
this program will take two numbers, process it, and returns
multiplied value and powered value of 'num1' and 'num2'. The twist of this
program is the program is made using addition operator only
